Putting a word onto it usually causes confusion, which is why there are a lot of redundant terms in the literature.\nModels may be able to tell us about two different types of change (within person vs between person change)"

Called measurement invariance. Complicates developmental work.\n2 or more measurement occasions. More is better! Though often 3 - 10 is practically fine for some models. With 30+ occasions you have “intensive” longitudinal data which presents new models and opportunities."
