## Standard regression 

$${Y}_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2} + b_{3}X_{3}+... +\epsilon_{i}$$

$$\hat{Y}_{i} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + b_{2}X_{2} + b_{3}X_{3}+...$$


Parameters are considered fixed where one regression value corresponds to everyone. I.e., that association between X1 and Y is the same for everyone. 

Each person has a Y, denoted by the subscript i, and each has a residual associated with them, also designated by i.

## Handling multiple DVs? 

But what if people had more than 1 DV, like we do with time? What do you do with multiple items, multiple trials, multiple ____ ? 

Two options: 1. Collapse and average across. 



## Example

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

simp<- tribble(
  ~ID, ~group,  ~test.score, ~study,
1,1,5,1,
2,1,7,3,
3,2,4,2,
4,2,6,4,
5,3,3,3,
6,3,5,5,
7,4,2,4,
8,4,4,6,
9,5,1,5,
10,5,3,7)
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
simp %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=study, y=test.score)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = factor(group)))
```


## could aggragate across group
```{r, echo = FALSE}
simp.1<- tribble(
  ~ID, ~group,  ~test.score, ~study,
  1,1,6,2,
  2,2,5,3,
  3,3,4,4,
  4,4,3,5,
  5,5,2,6)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
simp.1 %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=study, y=test.score)) +
    geom_point() +    
    geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +
  geom_point(data = simp, aes(colour = factor(group)))
```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simp %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=study, y=test.score, group = group)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = factor(group))) +   
    geom_smooth(aes(colour = factor(group)),method=lm,se=FALSE)
```


## Aggregation obscures hypotheses

- Between person H1: Do students who study more get better grades?   

- Within person H2: When a student studies, do they get better grades?
			        	
- H1 and H2 are independent from one another! Aggregation collapses the two. When you have nested data with many DVs (longitudinal but also almsot any experiemntal situation) it is important to not aggregate.  


## Stroop example

We calculate stroop scores by looking at repeated trials of congruent vs not congruent. This is dummy coded such that the $\beta_{1}$ reflects the average stroop effect. How much slower are people in incongruent trials? 

$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \varepsilon_i$$

What if we ran a separate regression for everyone? We can then think of $\beta_{1}$ as a PERSON SPECIFIC EFFECT. What is the stoop effect for you? 

We could think of $\beta_{1}$ as a random variable where people deviate on stroop effect from the average (ie fixed effect). You can then treat this as a regression, complete with a residual. 

$$\beta_{1} = \gamma_{10} +\gamma_{11}Z_i+ U_{1i}$$

## 4 ways to think about MLMs

1. Different levels of analysis (average/person specific or between/within)  
2. Regressions within regressions (ie coefficients as outcomes)  
3. Variance decomposition  
4. Learning from other data through pooling/shrinkage  


## GET NEW EXAMPLE HERE. 
```{r}
example <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh-jackson/longitudinal-2021/master/example.csv")
example$year <- example$week
```

```{r}
library(lme4)
mod.1 <- lmer(SMN7 ~ 1 + year + (1 | ID), data=example)
```

```{r}
summary(mod.1)
```


## regressions within regressions 
Helps to take multilevel and split it into the different levels. 

Level 1 is the smallest unit of analysis (students, waves, trials, family members)
    
Level 2 variables are what level 1 variables are “nested” in (people, schools, counties, families, dyads)

We are going to use level one components to run a regression, all the while level 1 is also estimating a regression


---

L1
$$Y_{trials, i} = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i}X_{trial,i} + \varepsilon_{trial,i}$$
      
L2
$$\beta_{0} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$
$$\beta_{1} = \gamma_{10} +\gamma_{11}Age_i+ U_{1i}$$

Our B1 coefficient indexes the stroop effect. However, people differ on this stroop effect. There is some average effect (fixed effect) that people vary around. Each person has some personal $\beta_1$, which we find using Level 1 data. From there we can also ask questions (with regressions) about that random variable. Is age associated with stroop scores, for example.


---

People differ on the stroop. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

set.seed(11)
ex.random <- example %>% 
  dplyr::select(ID) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  sample_n(3) 

example2 <-
  left_join(ex.random, example)  
  
g2<- ggplot(example2,
   aes(x = week, y = SMN7, group = ID)) +  geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~1, se = FALSE) + facet_wrap( ~ID) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .13) +  ylab("stroop effect") + xlab("trials") +
  geom_label(label="Grand mean ",  x=1,y=.13,
    label.size = 0.15) 
g2
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidybayes)
example %>% group_by(ID) %>%
  do(avg = tidy(lm(SMN7 ~ 1, data = .))) %>% 
  unnest(avg) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  stat_dotsinterval() + ylab("density")
```


## diferent levels and regressions within regressions 

To sum up the first two ways to think about regression, we take a relationship that could be simplified by aggregation, but instead we ask regression questions at different levels of analysis.  

At level 1 we can ask lower-unit questions e.g., if trials are nested within person, what predicts lengthier trials? 

At level 2 we can ask broader-unit questions. E.g., is age associated with stroop differences

Both levels are simple regressions. Level 2 uses coefficients from level 1 as DVs. 



## variance decomposition

For standard regression, we think of error as existing in one big bucket called $\varepsilon$ . Everything that we do not know goes into that bucket, from measurement error to unmeasured important factors. 

For MLMs we will be breaking up unexplained variance ( $\varepsilon$ ) into multiple buckets. Some of these buckets will be useful variance.  

These useful "buckets" (Us) are what we refer to as random/varying effects. 


$$Y_{trials, i} = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i}X_{trial,i} + \varepsilon_{trial}$$
 $$\beta_{0} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$     
$$\beta_{1} = \gamma_{10} +\gamma_{11}Z_i+ U_{1i}$$

Random effects used to be error, but they are going to be useful going forward. 

We will treat them as variables themselves e.g. individual differences in how people change  

They index how much people DIFFER on some effect. e.g. does everyone change the same, or are there differences in how people change?  

We can relate the random effects to other random effects e.g., do people who increase on X also start higher on X.   
 
 

## shrinkage/partial pooling

We treat our group variable as coming from a population. All groups are alike (because they are from the same population), but different in their own way. Because of this it is helpful to use information from other groups to help make predictions. 

We do this in standard regression where we make predictions based on values not only using data from X but from the whole dataset. A similar analogy for MLM is running a regression for each group. We want to pool as this leads to better predictions as we are not overfitting our data! 

---

If we take our simplified stroop effect model, where we are only looking at reaction time as a DV (ignoring the different types of trials) we could fit a model like this (an empty model)

L1
$$Y_{trials, i} = \beta_{0i} +  \varepsilon_{trial}$$
L2
$$\beta_{0} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$
 
Where does $U_{0i}$ come from? If we calculated each by hand, through taking the average rection time for a person i and subtracting that from the grand mean reaction time, would that equal $U_{0i}$ ?
 

## Complete, partial and no pooling

Complete assumes everyone is the same, with $U_{0i}$ being zero for everyone. 

No pooling is if we calculate every person's effect with a regression, subtracting out he grand mean average. 

Partial pooling is in the middle, a weighted average between the two. For those with fewer trials there is less information for a particular individual, thus the complete pooling estimate will be given more weight. If someone has a lot of data, there weighted average is closer to no pooling. 

Partial pooling prevents both over and under fitting of your data, leading to increased out of sample predictions. 

 

## Basic Longitudinal Models

To keep with the book, we are going to discuss DVs that take on different values at each timepoint t, for individual i ${Y}_{ti}$ Other naming schemes are equivalent such as the same ${Y}_{ij}$ where i's are nested in j groups. 


## Empty model

Level 1
$${Y}_{ti} = \beta_{0i}  + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

Level 2
$${\beta}_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$
 

$${e}_{ti} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2})$$

$${U}_{0i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_{00}^{2})$$


## What does this look like? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sample_n_of <- function(data, size, ...) {
  dots <- quos(...)
  
  group_ids <- data %>% 
    group_by(!!! dots) %>% 
    group_indices()
  
  sampled_groups <- sample(unique(group_ids), size)
  data %>% 
    filter(group_ids %in% sampled_groups)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
set.seed(24)


example %>%
  sample_n_of(8, ID) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = week, y = CON, group = ID)) + geom_point(aes(color = factor(ID))) + stat_smooth(aes(color = factor(ID)), method = "lm", formula=y~1, se = FALSE) + xlab("We dont have a predictor") + ylab("Y") + theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_hline(yintercept = .22, size = 1.5)
```


## combined equation

$${Y}_{ti} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}  + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

Akin to ANOVA if we treat $U_{0i}$ as between subjects variance & $\varepsilon_{ti}$ as within subjects variance.


$\gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$ is fixed or constant across people
$U_{0i}$ is random or varies across people




## ICC

Between version variance over total variance. If the ICC is greater than zero, we are breaking standard regression assumptions as this is an index of dependency. 

$$\frac{U_{0i}}{U_{0i}+ \varepsilon_{ti}}$$

ICC can also be interpreted as the average (or expected) correlation within a nested group, in this case a person. On other words, the ICC is the correlation between any person's repeated measures (technically residuals).

## Residuals

To get residuals and fitted scores

```{r}
library(broom.mixed)
example.aug<- augment(mod.1, data = example)

paged_table(example.aug)

# .fitted	 = predicted values
# .resid	= residuals/errors
# .fixed	 = predicted values with no random effects

```


## Predicted scores 

from model based and insight packages
```{r}
pred_data <- estimate_response(model)
vizdata$Predicted <- insight::get_predicted(model, vizdata)
```


## A predictor in level 1 


Level 1 is where you have data that repeats within your grouping or clustering data. Is your cluster classrooms? Then students are level 1. Is your cluster people? Then observations are level 1. 

$${Y}_{ti} = \beta_{0i}  + \beta_{1i}X_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

Notice on the subscript of X that these predictors vary across group (i) and within the group (t) So if your grouping (i) is people, then t refers to different observations.


---

Level 2 takes the parameters at level 1 and decomposes them into a fixed component ( $\gamma$ ) that reflects the average and, if desired, the individual deviations around that fixed effect (U).

level 1
$${Y}_{ti} = \beta_{0i}  + \beta_{1i}X_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

level 2
$${\beta}_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$  
$${\beta}_{1i} = \gamma_{10}$$  

---

What implied association between X and Y does this model fit for each person?  
What is constrained to be the same vs different? 

---

Including a random slope

level 1
$${Y}_{ti} = \beta_{0i}  + \beta_{1i}X_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

level 2
$${\beta}_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$  
$${\beta}_{1i} = \gamma_{10}+ U_{1i}$$ 
combined: 
$${Y}_{ti} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}(X_{ti})+ U_{0i} + U_{1i}(X_{ti}) + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

$${Y}_{ti} = (\gamma_{00} + U_{0i}) + (\gamma_{10}+  U_{1i})X_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}$$


---

By including random effects (U) you making a claim that every group/cluster does *not* have the same $\gamma$ ie intercept/regression coefficient. 

An advantage of MLM is to separate more "buckets" of variance that are unexplained. What was originally $e_{ti}$ is now ( $U_0$ + $U_1$ + $e_{ti}$ ). This additional decomposition of variance is beneficial because you are separating signal from noise, translating what was noise $e_{ti}$ into meaningful signal ( $U_0$ , $U_1$ , $U_2$ etc). 

For example, multiple responses per person can identify individual differences (eg not everyone shows the stroop effect) that normally would be chalked up to error. If you parse out this error your signal becomes stronger.


## person predictions

Can think of a persons score divided up into a fixed component as well as the random component. 

$${\beta}_{1.26} = \gamma_{10} \pm U_{26}$$ 
Also call BLUPs or empirical bayes estimates



## LONGIDUTIDNAL EXAMPLE
```{r}
mod.2f <- lmer(SMN7 ~ 1 + year + (1  | ID), data=example)
summary(mod.2f)
```

---

```{r}
mod.2 <- lmer(SMN7 ~ 1 + year + (year  | ID), data=example)
summary(mod.2)
```

# Visualizing results (quickly)


There are many ways to do this. The parameters package paired with the see package, both from the easystats package, are useful in this regard. 

```{r}
library(parameters)
library(see)

result <- model_parameters(mod.2)

plot(result)

```

---

```{r}
result2 <- simulate_parameters(mod.2)
plot(result2, show_intercept = TRUE)
```



---

```{r}
result3 <- model_parameters(mod.2,  effects = "random")
plot(result3)
```


These graphs however just take your output and make it look nice, in that the same information is still on the results. If we want to say, plot the predcted line we need to do an additional step and FEED the data back into the model. In doing so we create predicted values for each person (or each value of our predictor X), and then can visualize our findings as we would with a regression line. (More on this in the graphing workshop).

To do so we are going to need to use the ggeffects package

```{r}
library(ggeffects)
p.mod2 <- ggpredict(mod.2, "year")
p.mod2
```

---

```{r}
plot(p.mod2)
```

The error band here says that we are less confident in the predicted value as we get from year 
~4 and beyond. 



If you want you can also get predicted lines for a particular individual. 


```{r}
p.r.mod2 <- ggpredict(mod.2, "year", type = "random", condition = c(Subject = 97))
p.r.mod2
```

```{r}
plot(p.r.mod2)
```

---


```{r}
p.r.mod3 <- ggpredict(mod.2, c("year","ID[sample=9]"), type = "random")
plot(p.r.mod3)
```


---


```{r}
plot_model(mod.2, type = "re", grid = FALSE, sort.est = TRUE)
```


We will eventually be doing all of this "by hand" but it is helpful to start thinking about what sort of effects you want to visualize/display. 

```{r}
P.gg <- ggplot(example.aug, aes(x= year, y = .fitted)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm")   

P.gg

```










## Error Structure

The residual structure, where the random effects are again normally distributed with a mean of zero, but this time one must also consider covariance in addition to variance. 

G matrix (books term)
$$\begin{pmatrix} {U}_{0j} \\ {U}_{1j} \end{pmatrix}
\sim \mathcal{N} \begin{pmatrix} 
  0,      \tau_{00}^{2} & \tau_{01}\\ 
  0,  \tau_{01} & \tau_{10}^{2}
\end{pmatrix}$$
 


$${e}_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2})$$
The ${e}_{ij}$ is structured as a NxN matrix, where n reflect number of waves
 
Note that it is possible to impose a different error structure depending on your needs. 


##  Decomposing variance for random intercept model 

.pull-left[
$$\text{Total variance CS} = \begin{pmatrix} 
       \tau_{00}^{2} + \sigma^{2}& \tau_{00}^{2} & \tau_{00}^{2}\\ 
       \tau_{00}^{2} &  \tau_{00}^{2} + \sigma^{2} &  \tau_{00}^{2}\\
       \tau_{00}^{2} & \tau_{00}^{2} &   \tau_{00}^{2} + \sigma^{2}
\end{pmatrix}$$


$$\text{Btw-Person} = [\tau_{00}^{2} ]$$

]

.pull-right[

$$\text{Within-Person VC} = \begin{pmatrix} 
         \sigma^{2}& 0 & 0\\ 
       0 &  \sigma^{2} &  0\\
       0 & 0 &    \sigma^{2}
\end{pmatrix}$$


Within-person structure ranges from very constrained (same  variances assumes covariances are 0) to quite relaxed. 

$$\text{Within-Person UN} = \begin{pmatrix} 
         \sigma_{1}^{2}& \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13}\\ 
       \sigma_{21} &  \sigma_{2}^{2} &  \sigma_{23}\\
       \sigma_{31} & \sigma_{32} &    \sigma_{3}^{2}
\end{pmatrix}$$



]



## Error assumptions

Level 1 residuals are independent for Level 1 units across people   
AND 

Level 1 residuals are independent of random effects  

AND 

Level 1 residuals are the same magnitude across people 

We can modify a standard assumption: 
Level 1 residuals are independent within a person through different variance/covariance structures


## centering 

Because mlms are regressions, and because mlms involve interactions, it is important to consider how your predictors zero point is defined. 

How do you want your intercept interpreted? 
How do you want lower order terms in an interaction interpreted?


We will use these extensively to help disentangle within and between person variance. 


## Uncentered

The default will give you predicted score of intercept when all predictors are zero. 

Because most models will have a random intercept, it is important to keep in mind interpretations as we will be looking at variations around this value. 



## Grand mean Centered

Zero now represents that grand mean of the sample. Calculated by taking $x_{ti} - \bar{x}$

Useful as this is often our the default in other methods. Changes meaning of intercept but not slope. 

A related way to center is group grand mean centering where you take the mean of your grouping variables rather than the grand mean. 



## group mean centering (person centering)

Calculated by taking $x_{ti} - \bar{x_i}$

Can change meaning of intercept and slope. Intercept is now a person's average level rather than the samples average level (grand mean) and level when predictors = 0 (no centering)

Slope at level 1 is the expected change relative to a person's average. 



## Estimation 

We need to identify: 
1. the estimates of each parameter
2. some measure of precision of that estimate (SEs)
3. an index of overall model fit (deviance/-2LL/aic/bic)

We will use maximum likelihood (and variants of) as well as MCMC (Bayesian) for estimation. 

Model comparison is usually done through a likelihood ratio test distributed as a chi square. 


## ML vs REML

REML = Restricted maximum likelihood

Similar to sample vs population estimates of SD where we do or don't divide by n-1, ML downward biased random effect estimates. 

REML maximizes the likelihood of the residuals, so models with different fixed effects are not on the same scale and are not comparable. As a result, you cannot compare fixed models with likleihood metrics (aic) with REML. You can compare variance differences. 



## transitioning to longitudinal applications


We are going to fit a simple longitudinal model: a growth model. Growth model is just a fancy term for creating lines for each person. 


## within person empty model

 $${Y}_{ti} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}  + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

This model is helpful in producing the simplest longitudinal model, one where it states: there is an average value $\gamma_{00}$ that people differ along $U_{0i}$ . Because time is not in the model it assumes people do not change. $\varepsilon_{ti}$ reflects variation around each person's predicted score ( $\gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$ ). 


## Adding time

Level 1:
 
$${Y}_{it} = \beta_{0i}  + \beta_{1i}X_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}$$
  
Level 2:  
$${\beta}_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$  
$${\beta}_{1i} = \gamma_{10}$$ 

Any time we have a level 1 variable we can model it at level 2. If we want to assume it is constant across people, we do not include a random effect. 

---

Combined equation: 
 $${Y}_{ti} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10} (X_{1i})+ U_{0i}  + \varepsilon_{ti}$$

Because we have a level 1 time predictor in the model, we are now asking the question, how does time influence scores on our DV? Because all regressions are linear by default, it asks if there is an association such that as time increases does the DV? This describes a trajectory. 

What does this look like pictorially? 


## random slope

Level 1: 
$${Y}_{it} = \beta_{0i}  + \beta_{1i}X_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}$$
  
Level 2:  
$${\beta}_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + U_{0i}$$  
$${\beta}_{1i} = \gamma_{10} + U_{1i}$$

Combined: 
 $${Y}_{ti} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10} (X_{1i})+ U_{0i}  + U_{1i}(X_{1i}) + \varepsilon_{ti}$$



## correlations among random effects 

$$\begin{pmatrix} {U}_{0i} \\ {U}_{1i} \end{pmatrix}
\sim \mathcal{N} \begin{pmatrix} 
  0,     & \tau_{00}^{2} & \tau_{01}\\ 
  0, & \tau_{01} & \tau_{10}^{2}
\end{pmatrix}$$

The variances and the covariation (correlations) can be of substantive interest. What do each of these terms reflect? What if one of the terms was zero, what would that mean? 



## residual 

$$ {\varepsilon}_{ti} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2})  $$
Much like in normal regression models we often use $\sigma^{2}$ as a means to describe the fit of the model

---


![](5.3.png)




## model comparisons

In setting up the basic growth model we have a series of questions to address: 

1. Do we need to add a time component? 
2. If so, do we need to allow that to vary across people?
3. if so, do we want to allow the intercept to correlate with the slope? 

Usually 1 & 2 are explicitly tested whereas 3 is more theoretical

---

![](5.1.png)

---
## centering redux

The correlation among random intercept and slopes is directly related to centering of variables. The two standard choices for time is to center at the mean of time or at the start of time. Both have their pros and cons.
